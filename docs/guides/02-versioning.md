# Versioning

> All components must follow [Semver](http://semver.org/). For new components they should start in what's called "dev releases" at 0.0.0. While a component is in dev releases, it is considered unstable and not bound by normal Semver rules for versions above the first major release (1.0.0).

> Although Semver leaves dev releases open to do anything you want, we will only make breaking changes in minor versions (i.e. 0.1.0). Features and non-breaking patches will still go into their normal versions. Basically, we still follow Semver in dev releases except that breaking changes go into minor releases.

For the sake of keeping things simple, refer to the [Semver spec](http://semver.org/) for anything this document does not cover.
