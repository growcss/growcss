@growcss/image
------------

Speedy, optimized images without the work.

 It provides the fastest, most optimized image loading performance possible for React websites.

### Out of the box it:

- Loads the optimal size of image for each device size and screen resolution
- Holds the image position while loading so your page doesn’t jump around as images load
- Uses the “blur-up” effect i.e. it loads a tiny version of the image to show while the full image is loading
- Alternatively provides a “traced placeholder” SVG of the image.
- Lazy loads images which reduces bandwidth and speeds the initial load time
- Uses WebP images if browser supports the format
